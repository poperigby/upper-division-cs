### Class Schedule 

For the first week, and for rest of quarter.

### Two Tracks

12 open slots for Changemakers Lab, to participate directly in Team Companies with a responsibility of Tuesday - Thursday afternoon sessions,
to come up with their own learning goals and homework, and to benefit from the revolutionary ChangeMakers approach.

Returning DSA Students get preference, open to everyone.

Remaining students will get more time for pair programming, a curated selection of homeworks designed to teach and test your programming skills
for future technical jobs, and a chance to deep dive on computer science.

You can serve as a consultant for one of the ChangeMakers team companies, applying your knowledge from the homeworks to a real-world
problem found by you or your teammates, and build a piece for your portfolio or website.
