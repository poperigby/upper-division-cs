# Intro---Duality---Five Problems

## The Duality of Time and Space

Exercise:
* Pick a duality from another science, area of knowledge, popular culture, your favorite
movies and books. Describe how the duals complement and define each other, what role
balance plays, and how you can tradeoff one dual for another.

## The RAM Model

In Donald Knuth's classic and neverending text, *The Art of Computer Programming*, he invents and uses
an imaginary assembly language called MMIX. Some programmers may think that assembly language is too
low level and has no bearing on analyzing algorithms day to day, and they have a point: you don't need to 
understand the laws of quantum physics to use a computer, and yet this daily task rests on a foundation
of electrons tunneling between semiconductors of different types.

Underlying all algorithmic analysis on all modern computers that you can use today is the RAM Model,
which stands for (Random Access Memory). Other than being the greatest techno album of all time from
Daft Punk, Random Access Memory means that "constant-time access to any address." Whether you want to 
read address 

## Arrays

An array is the "bare metal" of the RAM Model, the ur-data-structure. It is the most direct access that
programmers have to the underlying hardware because it behaves exactly as the memory circuits do:
it's a vast contiguous grid of memory locations in sequential order, with address bits being input,
and the corresponding data bits being output (if it's a read-only operation) or with data bits being input
to overwrite the existing data (if it's a write operation).

Think of arrays as a row of lockers or house addresses on a street, with the quirk that the addresses start
at 0. The reason is that
