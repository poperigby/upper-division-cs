# Asymptotic Analysis

Infinity is a mysterious entity in mathematics.
In addition to having the property of being larger than any real number,
it helps define behaviors at a *limit*, for example, series of numbers
that proceed in an algorithmic way:

$$
\operatorname{ker} f=\{g\in G:f(g)=e_{H}\}{\mbox{.}}
$$

there is usually a formula to
proceed from
